**Project Description: Cat and Dog Classification using Deep Learning**

This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a labeled dataset to differentiate between cats and dogs with high accuracy. The dataset is preprocessed, augmented, and passed through a deep learning model to achieve optimal performance.  

**Key Features**
Deep Learning Model:  Built using TensorFlow/Keras with CNN architecture.  
Dataset Handling:  Uses Kaggleâ€™s Dogs vs. Cats dataset**, automatically downloaded and preprocessed.  
Data Preprocessing:  Images are resized, normalized, and augmented (rotation, flipping, and scaling) to improve generalization.  
Model Training & Evaluation: Tracks loss and accuracy metrics, displaying performance graphs.  
Real-time Testing:  Allows users to upload an image for classification.  
Performance Metrics:  Achieves high accuracy with minimal loss on test data.  

**Dataset Details**
Source: [Kaggle - Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)  
Images: Thousands of labeled cat and dog images  
Preprocessing Steps:  
  - Resizing images to 128x128 pixels  
  - Normalization for faster convergence  
  - Data augmentation to prevent overfitting  

 **How the Model Works** 
1. Dataset Loading & Preprocessing:** Reads images, resizes them, and applies transformations.  
2. CNN Model Training: Uses convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers to extract features.  
3. Evaluation & Results: Tests model performance using accuracy and loss graphs.  
4. Prediction System: Takes an input image and predicts whether it is a cat or a dog.  

 **Future Enhancements**  
- Use Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet) to improve accuracy.  
- Deploy Model as a Web App using Flask or Streamlit.  
- Optimize Hyperparameters for better performance.
